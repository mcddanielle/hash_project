## hash_project
### Repository contains the following
#### python codes
* `dumb_file_reader.py`: the primary code for reading the information
* `pa0_parser.py`: simple demo of reading a Pa0 file
* `pcw0_parser.py`: simple demo of reading a Pcw0 file

#### Parameters files (string <space> numeric value (float or int)
* Pa0
* Pcw0

#### Project:
rewrite the dumb_file_reader with a smarter data handling technique, such as a hash, so that you don't need to specify whether it is file type Pcw0, Pa0, or anything else, AND importantly, you don't have to change the file reader every time you change the parameter file

#### How to get involved:

1) Clone this repository
   pick a directory of choice, such as ~/Codes, (or make one), and type the following in the terminal from that directory:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/mcddanielle/hash_project.git`


2) Make your own branch:

   `git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch] `

Branches make a distinct copy of a code for experimenting without compromising the original code, so that you can play around.  An example might be:

     `git checkout -b ally_solution`


3) You are welcome to learn git commands to checkpoint and save your work.
